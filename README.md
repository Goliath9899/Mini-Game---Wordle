# Mini-Game---Wordle
This is my first project
The project consists of two Python files that together implement a basic version of the Wordle game, titled "GIRDEL". The main script, Wordle.py, employs the tkinter library to build a graphical user interface where users input 6-letter word guesses. The program provides visual feedback using a color-coded system: green indicates a correct letter in the correct position, yellow signifies a correct letter in the wrong position, and grey represents an incorrect letter. The target word is randomly selected from a predefined list provided in the words.py file, which includes a large collection of six-letter words and a function to return one at random. The code demonstrates modular design by separating the word bank from the game logic and incorporates fundamental programming techniques such as event handling, input validation, and conditional logic. Overall, the project showcases a beginner-friendly approach to replicating the core functionality of the original Wordle game.
